# Business Information Settings Guide

This guide explains how to configure your business information in the Chrisnov Invoice application. These settings control how your company's name, contact details, and logo appear on invoices and in emails.

## Accessing Business Settings

1. Navigate to **Settings** from the main sidebar.
2. Click on the **Business** card to access the business information page.

## Configuration Fields

### Business Details

- **Business Name (Required)**: Your official company or trading name. This will be prominently displayed on all invoices and communications.
- **Business Email (Required)**: The primary email address for your business. This will be used as the default reply-to address.
- **Business Phone**: Your company's contact phone number.
- **Business Website**: Your company's website URL (e.g., `https://yourcompany.com`).

### Business Address

- **Full Address (Required)**: Your complete business address. This will be displayed on invoices as the "Bill From" address.

### Business Logo

- **Upload Logo**: You can upload your company logo, which will appear on your PDF invoices. For best results, use a high-quality PNG, JPG, or GIF file.
- **Remove Logo**: If a logo has been uploaded, you can remove it at any time. Invoices will then be generated without a logo, showing only the business name.

### Invoice Settings

- **Default Tax Rate (%)**: The default tax rate that will be applied to new invoices. This can be overridden on individual invoices.
- **Default Currency**: The default currency for new invoices. This can also be changed on a per-invoice basis.

## How to Upload a Logo

2. Select your logo file from your computer.
3. Click the **Save Changes** button at the bottom of the page.
4. Your logo will now appear on all newly generated invoices.

## How to Remove a Logo

1. If a logo is present, a **Remove** button will appear next to the logo preview.
2. Click the **Remove** button.
3. The page will refresh, and the logo will be removed from the system.

## Where This Information Appears

- **PDF Invoices**: Your business name, address, contact details, and logo are all used to generate professional PDF invoices.
- **Emails**: Your business name and contact details are included in the signature of emails sent to clients.
- **Application UI**: Your business name is displayed in the application's sidebar.
